# BlackVault – next

The BlackVault wallet being rebuilt on Quasar 2, Vue 3 and Vite.
The current app in the repository root keeps working until this folder replaces it.

Requires Node 24 (see `../.nvmrc`).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:8090
npm run build        # PWA into dist/pwa
npm run typecheck
npm test             # core tests against next/src
npm run test:legacy  # the same tests against the current app in ../src
```

## Status

| Phase | Scope | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Test checklist (`../docs/TEST-CHECKLIST.md`), core tests | done |
| 1 | Quasar 2 + Vite toolchain, theme, assets, i18n, `core/` | done |
| 2 | Boot files and global services | – |
| 3 | Router and stack navigation | – |
| 4 | Pages and components | – |
| 5 | Electron | – |
| 6 | Mobile (Capacitor) | – |
| 7 | Lint, CI, cleanup | – |

Until phase 4 the app only shows a toolchain check page (`src/pages/ToolchainCheck.vue`)
that runs the wallet core in the browser.

## Core tests

`test/core` pins the stored-data formats with values generated independently of the
app (ethers for HD keys, Node crypto for the cipher format, see `test/fixtures.ts`).
Run both `npm test` and `npm run test:legacy` after touching `src/core`: if either
fails, wallets saved by an earlier version may no longer open.
